Hello.
astro_graph2.py contain codes for visualizing the .csv files. Change the data file name in code for different graphs.
bellcurved.py contains codes for the gaussian curve fit. Change file name for respective curve 
I have modified the mailed files and removed the first line with watermark and details from each datafile manually.
